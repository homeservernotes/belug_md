Bellevue Linux Users Group (BELUG) was established in early 2004 for the
purpose of promoting the study and use of Linux and other free software in
[Bellevue, WA](bellevue.html) and vicinity.

Free software, which is generally the same as *open source software*, is
software that is free both in a monetary sense and in that anyone is permitted
to use it for any desired purpose, including studying, modifying, extending,
giving away and even selling.

The use of free software is growing much faster than that of commercial
software, and its performance is likewise advancing more rapidly. Moreover,
many computer experts are convinced that free software is beginning to
revolutionize the computer industry and that it will eventually become the
dominant form of software. This revolution could be as massive and far-reaching
as the shift from standalone computers to the Internet that occurred in the
latter half of the 1990s.

Among the benefits of free software are:

1. Dramatically lower costs of acquisition,
2. Much greater ease of customization and *localization* (i.e., modification
   for specific human languages and cultures),
3. Shorter development times for new and improved versions,
4. Greatly enhanced security,
5. Improved compliance with industry-wide standards, and
6. A wider range of choices for users[^1].

The effects of the free software revolution will likely spread far beyond the
software industry: they could have major repercussions not only for other
industries (e.g., new ways of organizing product development and production)
but also for entire regional and national economies and societies. As this
revolution is still in its infancy, now is an excellent time to learn more
about it-and even participate in it.

Bellevue is one of the leading cities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and it is
home to [many high-tech companies](bellevue_corporations.html) and to a large
number of software professionals. The future of Bellevue and its environs lies
in advanced technology (as well as in its outstanding living environment), thus
it is only natural that this city should have its own [Linux Users
Group](http://www.linfo.org/lug.html) (LUG)[^2].

The main goals of BELUG are to:

1. Promote the use of Linux and other free software, and
2. Provide information about such software both to [BELUG
   members](belug_members.html) and to the world as a whole.

These activities are conducted largely through regular [monthly
meetings](meetings.html) and this website.

A focal point of BELUG's activities is the encouragement of its members to
start creative and public service projects related to free software or to
computers in general. In many cases, BELUG can provide a variety of types of
assistance for such projects.

BELUG's premier project is [The Linux Information
Project](http://www.linfo.org), which was launched in 2004 for the purposes of:

1. Making high-quality, comprehensive, and accessible information about Linux
   and other free software freely available worldwide, and
2. Studying how to best present large amounts of information about some
   specialized topic on the web.

Subsequently, on the basis of the success of LINFO, the LINMO (linked
information modules) project was launched in May 2006. This project has
developed a simple model that describes content-rich websites that maximize
usefulness for the largest possible audience and a set of largely intuitive
guidelines for implementing the model.

Additional information about BELUG is available on the pages [BELUG
FAQ](faq.html) and [BELUG Meetings](meetings.html).
