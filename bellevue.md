title: "Bellevue, WA: A Brief Introduction"
---

Bellevue is a unique city that is located near Seattle in western Washington
State in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. 

Although it is only the fifth largest city in Washington in terms of population
(currently approximately 117,000), it has the second largest downtown in the
state (and the third largest downtown in the entire northwestern part of the
U.S.), and it has an influence that is increasingly extending throughout the
U.S. and far beyond.

## Brief History

The region was sculpted by the massive glaciers that covered it during the last
ice age. Evidence of that era is clearly visible today in the form of the
numerous lakes of all sizes that dot the area (including some that are scarcely
known even to locals). After the ice retreated, the land became thickly
carpeted with evergreen forests whose remnants are still visible today even in
highly urbanized areas.

Bellevue's first human inhabitants probably arrived at least 12,000 years ago.
They lived in longhouses that were constructed from large planks and were often
located near the mouths of rivers. The area provided plentiful foodstuffs,
including abundant supplies of berries, *wapato* (an edible root native to the
region), fish, and birds.

The first recorded visit by a person of European descent to Lake Washington
(which is just to the west of Bellevue) occurred in the summer of 1850. The
first such settlers in what is now Bellevue began constructing log cabins in
the late 1860s or early 1870s, and the area became a popular location for the
summer homes of residents of nearby Seattle.

Sadly, most of the original inhabitants were decimated by a smallpox epidemic
in the 1770s, and most of the survivors had already been moved to reservations
by the time the first people of European descent began settling the area.

The towering evergreens gradually gave way to agriculture, and throughout the
first half of the 20th century Bellevue was dominated by farms that were best
known for their strawberries and blueberries.

The completion of the first floating bridge across Lake Washington in 1940 set
the stage for further change by greatly reducing the time required to reach
Seattle. It opened the floodgates to a suburban lifestyle that dominated the
area through the next four decades. Bellevue was officially incorporated as a
city in 1953, by which time it had acquired a population of 5,940.  

## Outstanding Combination of Factors

Today Bellevue is much more than just another sleepy suburban bedroom
community; it has metamorphosed into a large and increasingly cosmopolitan
commercial, retail, and residential powerhouse that is the core of the region
to the east of Lake Washington that is referred to locally as *the Eastside*.
This is the result of a number of factors that have converged to make Bellevue
not just a unique place but also an outstanding one in which to live, work,
visit, run a business, and even retire. A key to these factors is its excellent
location. 

For example, the region is blessed with a generally pleasant climate, due in
part to the moderating effects of Lake Washington and Puget Sound. Winters are
relatively mild with only occasional snowfall (except in the nearby mountain
ranges) and few severe storms. Summers are warm and sunny, and only a few days
each year are hot enough to make people want air conditioning.

Moreover, the region is surrounded by vast (and largely protected) wilderness
areas, including the rugged Cascade mountains a short distance to the east and
the Olympic mountains further to the west. These unspoiled open spaces provide
outstanding recreational opportunities and pleasant views from much of
Bellevue. The Cascades also provide an ample (in most years) supply of
high-quality drinking water. 

Bellevue also features proximity to three of the cities widely considered to be
among the best places to live in all of North America. It is only about 15 or
20 minutes to the east of Seattle, the largest city in the U.S. northwest, just
a few hours north of Portland, Oregon, and just a few hours south of Vancouver,
B.C., the biggest city in Western Canada. 

Despite its relative youth, Bellevue has a vigorous and growing cultural scene.
Among the most popular of the city's numerous cultural facilities is the
Bellevue Regional Library, which is the flagship branch of the King County
library system, one of the largest public library systems in the U.S.

Downtown also contains Meydenbauer Center, a full-service convention center and
theater on the eastern edge of downtown. Right in the center of downtown is the
new and distinctive Bellevue Art Museum, which, despite some initial teething
problems, promises to become a major regional cultural resource. The downtown
core also contains several movie theaters and art galleries.  

Bellevue also has its own symphony orchestra and an opera company. Moreover, it
is home to the annual summer Pacific Northwest Arts and Crafts Festival, one of
the largest outdoor events of its type and one which attracts participants and
visitors from many other states and Canada. Bellevue's cultural life will be
further boosted by a major center for the performing arts, construction of
which is expected to begin in the near future.

Bellevue also boasts outstanding shopping facilities that cater to every taste
and income level. For example, downtown is home to Bellevue Square, which is
consistently rated as one of the finest shopping centers in the U.S. and one of
the top visitor destinations in the Pacific Northwest. 

Bellevue also boasts an extensive and well-maintained park system that rivals
any in the Northwest. For example, a major feature of downtown is the
appropriately named Downtown Bellevue Park, a large (20 acres) and elegant
green space dominated by a half-mile long circular promenade that is a popular
place for jogging, walking, and socializing. A parallel canal ends in a
waterfall and a large pond that reflects the evergreens and skyscrapers in the
distance. 

Parks, trails, and other protected areas account for 14 percent of the city's
total area. This figure does not include the more than 50 miles of free-running
streams in the city, some of which are used by salmon for their migrations to
and from the Pacific Ocean. For this reason, Bellevue is sometimes referred to
as *a city within a park*.

Bellevue is also proud of its education system, as its schools rank among some
of the best in the U.S. For example, Bellevue Community College (BCC) is
consistently rated as one of the top institutions of its kind, and it draws its
large and growing student body from throughout the world. BCC is particularly
strong in the computer and bioinformatics fields, and there are increasing
indications that it will eventually be transformed into a four-year
institution. More than 50 percent of the population of Bellevue has at least a
bachelor's degree, as compared with approximately 40 percent for King County
(which includes both Bellevue and Seattle) as a whole and about 25 percent for
the U.S. as a whole.

The city also has excellent medical facilities. For example, Overlake Hospital,
the core of the medical district on the eastern edge of downtown, has grown
into one of the largest and highest-rated medical complexes in the northwestern
U.S. and it is currently embarking on another major expansion project. 

All of this is helping Bellevue to become a city with a livable downtown (which
is still unusual in much of the U.S.). In fact, the number of downtown
residents has been expanding in recent years and it is even becoming somewhat
of a retirement destination because of its unique combination of convenience
(including the ability to walk to a wide and growing array of shopping,
restaurants, and cultural facilities), safety, good climate, and excellent
medical facilities.

## A High Tech Center

Not only is Bellevue a leader in lifestyle, but it has also become an economic
powerhouse and a center for corporate headquarters. As home to dozens of
high-tech companies, the city's skyline is no longer composed of just towering
evergreens but also of an increasing number of glass-clad skyscrapers. This is
due not only to the high quality of life, but also to such factors as the high
level of education in the area and the strength of the increasingly diversified
local economy. 

Another important factor has been the presence of software giant Microsoft
Corporation. Although that company is technically no longer headquartered in
Bellevue, it remains just a stone's throw beyond city limits on the edge of
adjacent Redmond, and it retains facilities in Bellevue. Many of Microsoft's
employees and its highly entrepreneurial alumni call Bellevue home, and its
founder, and the world's richest man, lives just a short distance from Bellevue
in nearby Medina. 

But Bellevue is [far more than just a one-company
town](bellevue_corporations.html). It is also home to a whole host of other
computer and high-tech companies, many of which are the pioneering and most
innovative firms in their fields. Several major old-time companies are also
headquartered in Bellevue, including Paccar Inc., one of the world's largest
manufacturers of heavy-duty trucks, and Puget Sound Energy, Washington state’s
largest energy utility.  

Despite this increasingly big-city ambiance, Bellevue still retains somewhat of
a small-town feel, including many of the advantages that smaller communities
can offer. This is in part a result of a deliberate policy of *smart growth*,
which attempts to direct growth of population and businesses into the downtown
core while preserving the city's numerous and diverse residential neighborhoods
and their relaxed lifestyles. 

## Big Future

Although there are many good things that can be said about Bellevue, the city
is far from perfect. For example, like most American cities, the downtown is
still blighted by numerous ugly parking lots and strip malls, and the quality
of the urban experience, although improving, pales in comparison to most cities
in Europe and in comparison to large American cities such as New York, San
Francisco, and even Seattle.

The air is occasionally visibly polluted, and on some days there is excessive
aircraft noise. Moreover, in contrast to other West Coast cities including
Portland and Vancouver B.C., which are steadily expanding their already
